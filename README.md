# Google Search Results To Block Certain Sites

###### Description: This is a subscription rule used by myself, usually in the use of Google search in Chinese when you encounter a spam site to black up, and then update this address to the file.

#### uBlacklist What does it do?

###### uBlacklist is a browser extension that removes websites from appearing in your search results for predefined rules, currently supported by search engines such as Google DuckDuckGo. Use it to block spam or machine-translated websites from appearing in your search results, so you can get useful search results more efficiently and enjoy a better search experience.
